-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class Organization

	- lectures are designed around explaining the way and providing
	  the how

		+ a complete learning experience

		+ understand the programming language as a whole

		+ lacking in most Udemy courses

	- powerpoint slides

		+ a way to present abstract concepts and definitions
		  that I am not able to demonstrate in code (as easily)

		+ not just reading from slides!

			- providing insight via experience

			- providing thorough explanations


Demonstrations of Code

	- demonstrations in the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

		+ code examples (concrete, real-world)

		+ more practical/hands-on learning

	- challenges (coding assignment/projects)

		+ a way for you to assess your own learning

			- code alongs - walking through the code of a
			  solution for a particular challenge

			- all source code provided in class
