Section 01: The C99 Standard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

	- we have already discussed some concepts of the C programming
	  language (beginner class) that were included in the C99 standard

		+ bool data type - stdbool.h (added true/false keywords)

		+ variable length arrays

		+ single line comments

	- however, we have mainly focused on the C89 standard in the
	  beginner class

	- I want to be clear that some concepts in this class will
	  include functionality from the C99 standard


History

	- C99 is a revised standard for the C programming language

		+ refines and expands the capabilities of Standard C

	- C99 has not been widely adopted

		+ not all popular C compilers support it

		+ of the compilers that do offer C99 support, most
		  support only a subset of the language

	- so, we do not focus on many of the additions added for 
	  C99

		+ this is why the focus is mainly on C89

	- C89 is almost universally supported


New Features Added that We will Use I

	- macros with a variable number of arguments

	- C99 allows the use of sophisticated numbers (complex.h)

		+ _Complex

			- used to declare complex floating type 
			  variables to store mathematical complex
			  numbers

		+ _Imaginary

			- declare imaginary floating type variables
			  to store mathematical imaginary numbers

	- designmated initializers

		+ allow you to initialize the elements of an array,
		  union, or struct explicitly by subscript or name

	- restricted pointers

		+ a type qualifier that can be used only for poitners


New Features Added that We Will Use II

	- new comment techniques

		+ C99 allows to put comment using a double front
		  slash (//)

	- inline functions

		+ supplies a hint for the compiler to perform
		  optimizations

	- variable length arrays

		+ array dimension has to be declared in C89

		+ C99 permits declaration of array dimensions
		  using integer variables or any valid integer
		  expressions

	- flexible array members

		+ allows us to declare an array of unspecified
		  length as the last member of a struct


New Features Added that We Will Use III

	- declaration of variables

		+ it is now legal to declare variables at any
		  point of the program within the curly braces
		  of main() function

		+ very obvious in loops

	- required in C89 (all variables be declared at the 
	  start of a block)

	  int i;
	  for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)

	- new in C99 (variable can be declared anywhere)

	  for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
